# CasinoJam

CasinoJam is a casino game built on top of the SAGE Game Framework. It leverages asset-based state transitions to model all game entities—such as players, slot machines, seats, and trackers—allowing for flexible and decentralized game state management.

## Game Overview

In CasinoJam, every game entity is represented as an asset:
  
- **Player Assets:**  
  - **HumanAsset:** Represents a human player.
  - **TrackerAsset:** Tracks gameplay data for a player.

- **Machine Asset:**  
  - **BanditAsset:** Represents a slot machine (commonly referred to as "Bandit"). It includes properties like the number of linked seats and limits.

- **Seat Asset:**  
  Represents a seat that can be reserved by a player. It holds information such as the current occupant (`PlayerId`) and the associated machine (`MachineId`).

## Key Transitions and Mechanics

- **Player Creation:**  
  A player creation transition creates both a HumanAsset and a TrackerAsset for a new player.

- **Machine Creation:**  
  A machine creation transition (e.g., creating a BanditAsset) initializes a new slot machine.

- **Deposits & Withdrawals:**  
  Transitions allow players to deposit funds into their asset accounts or withdraw winnings.

- **Gamble:**  
  The gamble transition simulates a slot-machine spin. It uses utility functions to generate random spin outcomes, pack slot results into a compact format, and compute rewards based on multipliers and token types.

- **Seat Reservations, Release, and Kick:**  
  - **Reserve:** A player may reserve a seat (SeatAsset), linking their HumanAsset via a `SeatId`.
  - **Release:** Allows a player to cancel their reservation, resetting the linkage and refunding any reservation fee.
  - **Kick:** If a reservation expires or falls outside a grace period, another player can kick the occupant to claim the reservation fee.

## Asset Relationship Overview

The core assets in CasinoJam are interconnected as follows:

- **HumanAsset & TrackerAsset:**  
  Created together when a player joins the game.
  
- **HumanAsset & SeatAsset:**  
  A HumanAsset may reserve a SeatAsset. The HumanAsset’s `SeatId` indicates which seat the player occupies, while the SeatAsset’s `PlayerId` holds the ID of the occupying HumanAsset.

- **BanditAsset & SeatAsset:**  
  A SeatAsset is linked to a BanditAsset via its `MachineId`. The BanditAsset controls how many seats it can have (using `SeatLinked` and `SeatLimit`).

## Testing and Game Flow

CasinoJam comes with a comprehensive suite of tests covering:
- **Player and Machine creation**
- **Deposits and withdrawals**
- **Gamble transitions with varying multipliers**
- **Seat reservation, release, and kick operations**

These tests simulate full game scenarios, ensuring that all transitions update asset states and balances correctly.
